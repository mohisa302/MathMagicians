          simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. has been
          the industrys standard dummy text ever since the 1500s when an unknown
          printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen
          book.

          It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
          electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
          popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
          containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
          publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem
          Ipsum.

          Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It
          has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making
          it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
          Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure
          Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage
